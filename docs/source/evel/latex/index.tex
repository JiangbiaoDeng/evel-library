\section*{Introduction}

The E\+C\+O\+M\+P Vendor Event Listener (\char`\"{}\+E\+V\+E\+L\char`\"{}) library encapsulates the use of A\+T\&T\textquotesingle{}s J\+S\+O\+N A\+P\+I to the collector function within the E\+C\+O\+M\+P infrastructure.

As such, it provides a reference implementation of the E\+V\+E\+L J\+S\+O\+N A\+P\+I which can either be directly as part of a project or can be used to inform the independent implementation of an equivalent binding to the A\+P\+I in another development environment.

This section provides an overview of the library and how it is integrated into the target application. If all you want is a set of instructions to get you started, the \hyperlink{quickstart}{Quick Start} section is for you. If you want a more in-\/depth understanding of the {\itshape E\+V\+E\+L Library} then this section provides an overview and then you can read the detailed A\+P\+I documentation for each function. The documentation for \hyperlink{evel_8h}{evel.\+h} is a good starting point, since that defines the public A\+P\+I of the {\itshape E\+V\+E\+L Library}.

\section*{Library Structure}

The A\+P\+I is designed to be used on multi-\/process platforms where each process may be multi-\/threaded. Each process using this library will create an independent H\+T\+T\+P client (using libc\+U\+R\+L). Each process will have a single thread running the H\+T\+T\+P client but that thread receives work on a ring-\/buffer from however may threads are required to implement the function.

{\bfseries Note}\+: libcurl imposes a constraint that it is initialized before the process starts multi-\/threaded operation.

\section*{Typical Usage}

The library is designed to be very straightforward to use and lightweight to integrate into projects. The only serious external dependency is on libc\+U\+R\+L.

The supplied Makefile produces a single library {\bfseries libevel.\+so} or {\bfseries libevel.\+a} which your application needs to be linked against.

Each process within the application which wants to generate events needs to call \hyperlink{evel_8h_aff020c5505e724b414ac981e2a23fcd6}{evel\+\_\+initialize} at the start of day (observing the above warning about not being M\+T safe at this stage.) The initialization specifies the details of where the A\+P\+I is located. Management of configuration is the responsibility of the client.

Once initialized, and now M\+T-\/safe, there are factory functions to produce new Faults (\hyperlink{evel__fault_8c_ae31203fde9153686a32b2fc2a1183fa0}{evel\+\_\+new\+\_\+fault}) and new Measurements (\hyperlink{evel__scaling__measurement_8c_a162ce37ab7f24dbbea23d46b77c974ce}{evel\+\_\+new\+\_\+measurement}).

The Fault and Measurement structures are initialized with mandatory fields at the point of creation and optional fields may be added thereafter. Once set, values in the structures are immutable.

Once the event is prepared, it may be posted, using \hyperlink{evel__event__mgr_8c_a209d2e5dbffe9e11ac79ae140f4a81bd}{evel\+\_\+post\+\_\+event}, at which point the calling thread relinquishes all responsibility for the event. It will be freed once successfully or unsuccessfully posted to the A\+P\+I. If, for any reason, you change your mind and don\textquotesingle{}t want to post a created event, it must be destroyed with \hyperlink{evel_8h_a91faa4e06c4b079c2a8a1db1ccb2e47b}{evel\+\_\+free\+\_\+event}.

Finally, at the end of day, the library can be terminated cleanly by calling \hyperlink{evel_8h_ab3f6225ddb9c5113d74503d4fcd17e5b}{evel\+\_\+terminate}.

\end{DoxyCode}


The public A\+P\+I to the library is defined in \hyperlink{evel_8h}{evel.\+h}. The internal A\+P\+Is within library are defined in separate headers ({\itshape e.\+g.} \hyperlink{evel__internal_8h}{evel\+\_\+internal.\+h}), but these should not need to be included by the code using the library.

\section*{Example Application}

A simple command-\/line application to generate events is provided as part of the source package (the above code fragment is taken from that application).

\section*{Restrictions and Limitations}

\subsection*{Constraint Validation}

The {\itshape E\+V\+E\+L Library} has been designed to be production-\/safe code with the emphasis at this stage being in correctness of operation rather than raw performance.

The A\+P\+I tries to check as much information as possible to avoid misuse and will {\bfseries assert()} if constraints are not satisfied. This is likely to lead to the rapid discovery of coding errors by programmers, but does mean that the application can fail abruptly if the library is misused in any way.

\subsection*{Performance}

The default Makefile avoids aggressive optimizations so that any core-\/files are easy to interpret. Production code should use greater optimization levels.

As described above, the H\+T\+T\+P client is single threaded and will run all transactions synchronously. As transactions are serialized, a client that generates a lot of events will be paced by the round-\/trip time.

It would be a straightforward enhancement to use the multi-\/thread A\+P\+I into libcurl and use a pool of client threads to run transactions in parallel if this ever became a bottleneck.

\subsection*{Logging}

The initialization of the library includes the log verbosity. The verbose operation makes the library very chatty so syslog may get rather clogged with detailed diagnostics. It is possible to configure syslog to put these events into a separate file. A trivial syslog.\+conf file would be\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 # Log all user messages so debug information is captured.
2 
3 user.*      /var/log/debug
\end{DoxyCode}


If verbose logging is enabled, the c\+U\+R\+L library will generate information about the H\+T\+T\+P operations on {\bfseries stdout}.
